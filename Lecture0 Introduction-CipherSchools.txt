Scope of Data Science
---------------------------

Nowadays we are completely surrounded by data. Data Science is all around or we can say completely surrounded 
by use case of data Science and its application. There is a great scope of Data Science. Nowadays we are familiar
with AI tools such as Chatgpt, Gemini etc. which uses llm(large language models) are common example of data science.
Some more common example of data science generally around us are like Social Media applications such as an Instagram
,youtube in which recommendation system is working behind which is giving output based on our preferences. Another e.g.
is Food delivery apps like Zomato,Swiggy uses data science for tracking the delivery, time of delivery, Discount on Food order,
Food preference based on our previous orders .In fact Data Science is now being used in every field.
