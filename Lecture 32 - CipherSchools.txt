Lecture 32 - Introduction To neural Networks And Deep Learning


What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a powerful machine learning technique that uses artificial neural networks to learn and make predictions from large amounts of data, It can tackle complex problems that were once considered difficult for computers to Deep teaming models are trained on massive
datasets, allowing them to discover intricate patterns and extract meaningful features automatically. This makes deep learning exceptionally well-suited for tasks tike image
recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.


What is Neural Networks?

Neural networks are a powerful machine learning technique inspired by the human brain. They can uncover hidden patterns, make accurate predictions. and solve complex problems that traditional algorithms struggle with. This adaptability, nonlinearity, and scalability is what makes neural networks so transformative across many industries.
