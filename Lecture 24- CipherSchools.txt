Lecture 24- Correlation Concept

Correlation 

Definition:

Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.

concepts:

--Strength of relationship

--Direction of relationship


Types of Correlation Coefficients

1.Pearson Correlation Coefficient: Measures the linear relationship between two continuous
variables. It assumes that the variables follow a normal distribution.

2.Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient: A non-parametric measure of rank correlation,
assessing how well the relationship betwee two variables can be described using a monotonic
function.

3.Kendall's Tau: Another rank-based correlation coefficient, often used for data with a natural ordinal classification.



Understanding a Correlation Matrix
A correlation matrix displays correlation coefficients between sets of variables. Each cell in the matrix represents the correlation between two variables.
