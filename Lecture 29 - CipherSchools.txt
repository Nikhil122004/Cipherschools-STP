Lecture 29 - Introduction To Machine Learning


What is Al ?

• Simulation of Human intelligence processes by machines
Or
• It is the ability for a computer to think and learn.

Term used in Ai
Learning

Reasoning

Self-Correction



What is ML?

• Machine learning is the subset of Al that uses statistical methods to allow machines to improve their results with the amount of training data fed to it.

Types of ML

Supervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning


ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
Any technique which enables computers to mimic human behavior

MACHINE LEARNING
Al techniques that give computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed to do so.

DEEP LEARNING
A subset of ML which make the computation of multi-layer neural networks feasible.

What is Data science?

• Data Science is a field of study involving statistical tools and techniques to
extract meaningful insights from data.
• The data from which these insights are extracted can come from various sources, including databases, business transactions, sensors, and more.
• Data science uses complex machine learning algorithms to build predictive
models.
